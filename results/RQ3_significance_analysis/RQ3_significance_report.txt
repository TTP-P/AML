=== RQ3 – Significance Analysis: LightGBM vs LightGBM_RQ1_RQ3 ===
Number of samples: 17,651

Baseline MAE   : 7.60507
Enhanced MAE   : 7.60043
Mean Improvement (Δ) : 0.00463
Effect size (Cohen's d) : 0.005

Paired t-test : t = 0.666, p = 5.057e-01
Wilcoxon test : W = 76913483.500, p = 1.476e-01

Interpretation:
The enhanced model (LightGBM_RQ1_RQ3) achieved a statistically non-significant 
reduction in MAE compared to the baseline LightGBM model.
This confirms that incorporating network and community-level features (RQ3)
does not yield a statistically measurable improvement.
